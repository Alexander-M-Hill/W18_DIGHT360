Text Processing and Analysis

The [syllabus](https://learningsuite.byu.edu/view/-iEn0dQxauwU.html) and
assignments are on [Learning Suite](https://learningsuite.byu.edu).

The textbook for the course is [Think Python](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/).

[Pythex](http://pythex.org) is a useful resource for learning or debugging
regular expressions in python.

Friends don't let friends write ugly code. You can check your code formatting
using [flake8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8), especially when combined
with a linter, such as the `linter-flake8` plugin for [Atom](http://atom.io).
You can also check code formatting online at [PEP8 Online](http://pep8online.com/).

To help you sleep better at night, you can always access an interactive python
shell online [here](https://www.python.org/shell/) or [here](https://www.pythonanywhere.com).
